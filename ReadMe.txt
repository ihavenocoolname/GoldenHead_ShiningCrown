Returning to GoldenHead idea.

I'm still learning to crawl with Python, but I can see the paths I need to walk. 
I've been exploring the fitnes daily summaries .CSV files, and cross referencing them with my 
-SMS
-Location
-Photos
-Google Search History

There ARE patterns buried in my data. I was approaching my initial project with the correct intentions, but the 
incorrect tools. I need to simplify the problem. Don't start with an Android app. Don't start with live feeds of data.

WHAT TO DO NEXT:
-Build a prototype in Python using my archived files.

-Pedometer data seems to be the most obvious, reliable method for inferring periods that require attention.

-Look for statistically significant correlations with pedometer readings

-matplotlib is your friend
